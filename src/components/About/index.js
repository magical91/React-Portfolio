                    Hello my name is Marissa Martinez. I am a software developer currently enrolled in a coding boot camp through Michigan
                    State University. After a long period of working minimum wage jobs I finally decided to go back to school. Not just to
                    learn something new but to open new opportunities for me and my future. I have tons of aspirations to achieve my goals,
                    and through coding I have finally found the motivation that I needed in my life. Below are some of my projects that
                    I've worked through my time in the coding boot camp. Go ahead and take a look.
