# React Portfolio

On this week's project I worked with react to build a single page application(SPA). The main components built into the navigation bar are the "about me" section with a brief bio about me; A contact form to get in touch with me; My portfolio with 6 of my most recent projects; and my resume with my proficiencies incluced. At this point I did the minimal viable product due to limited timing to turn in assignment, but will improve in the near future.

## Purpose

To present a react-build portfolio
